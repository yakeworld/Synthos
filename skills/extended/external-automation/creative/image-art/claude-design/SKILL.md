# Claude Design for CLI/API Agents

Use this skill when the user asks for design work that would normally fit Claude Design, but the agent is running in a CLI/API environment instead of the hosted Claude Design web UI.

The goal is to preserve Claude Design's useful design behavior and taste while removing hosted-tool plumbing that does not exist in normal agent environments.

**Before starting, check for other web-design skills like `popular-web-designs` (ready-to-paste design systems for Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Notion, etc.) and `design-md` (Google's DESIGN.md token spec format).** If the user wants a known brand's look, load `popular-web-designs` alongside this one and let it supply the visual vocabulary. If the deliverable is a token spec file rather than a rendered artifact, use `design-md` instead. Full decision table below.

## When To Use This Skill vs `popular-web-designs` vs `design-md`

Hermes has three design-related skills under `skills/creative/`. They do different jobs — load the right one (or combine them):
